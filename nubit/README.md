If you have created the wallet and would like to repleace with your own. please following the step by step: 

Before do it, please stop the node by press `ctrl+c`

### Set up environment

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:$(pwd)/bin
export NETWORK=nubit-alphatestnet-1
export NODE_TYPE=light
export PEERS=/ip4/34.222.12.122/tcp/2121/p2p/12D3KooWJJWdaCB8GRMHuLiy1Y8FWTRCxDd5GVt6A2mFn8pryuf3
export VALIDATOR_IP=validator.nubit-alphatestnet-1.com
export GENESIS_HASH=AD1DB79213CA0EA005F82FACC395E34BE3CFCC086CD5C25A89FC64F871B3ABAE
export AUTH_TYPE=admin
export store=$HOME/.nubit-${NODE_TYPE}-${NETWORK}/
export NUBIT_CUSTOM="${NETWORK}:${GENESIS_HASH}:${PEERS}"
```

### Delete wallet
You can either keep the new one (which created at first run) or delete it. 

To deleted it: 

```bash
rm -r ~/.nubit-light-nubit-alphatestnet-1/keys/
```

Please ignore it command above, if you would like to keep the key. 

### Import wallet with mnemonic
